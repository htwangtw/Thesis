The most exciting chapter of my academic journey would not be possible without my supervisors Dr. Jonathan Smallwood and Prof. Elizabeth Jefferies. Jonny and Beth are the kindest human I have ever known. Their help and support in both science and life have made this PhD a truly rewarding experience. I have not only become a better scientist, but also a better person. Especially, I cannot be more thankful for Jonny's trust in my ability to do this PhD when I was doubtful of my own ability. That offer really changed my life. 

I express my gratitude to Prof. Dr. Dr. Danilo Bzdok for the guidance and discussions on the canonical correlation analysis project. Danilo has influenced my scientific thinking more than I can give him credit for here. 

I thank my thesis  advisory  panel, Dr. Tom Hartley, Dr. Aidan Horner, and Dr. Cade McCall for providing a friendly environment to discuss science and my skill development. The meetings were truly a pleasure! 

All the research projects presented here will not be possible without the current and past members of semantics and thought lab. Their contributions lie not just in the research, and also moral supports on my personal life. Good colleagues like them are difficult to come by.  

I reserved this space for Thomas Hardman, whose love, support and bad taste on YouTube videos that has brought me infinite joy. 

Finally, thanks to all my family and friends for all their assistance. Special mention to Rebecca Jones for all her supports during this three years through food and friendship.

% abstract text
\def\contentabstract{
The literature of on-going experience is full of conflicts. [Why so many problems.]
In the current thesis, a family resemblances view on the component processes of on-going thought is examined through multivariate pattern analysis on intrinsic functional connectivity and behaviors related to on-going thought. [what we found.] In conclusion, the heterogeneity of on-going thought lies in the involvement of overlapping sets of component with similarities.
