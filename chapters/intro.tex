\section{Mind wandering as a Heterogeneous Phenomenon}
In the past decade, mind wandering has gained wider interest in science. Researchers aim at understanding how the mind shifts between external environment and internal thoughts unrelated to the here-and-now. The study of mind wandering roughly fall into two categories, the characteristic of mind wandering (i.e. how human mind wanders.) and the processes that generate it (i.e. why human mind wanders.). Both aspects are essential of the study of mind wandering. However, the two approaches have led to a conflict in the study of mind wandering in various aspects. 

\subsection{Heterogeneity in definitions}
In past years, mind wandering has been studied in a variety of related psychological domains, such as cognition, emotion, and neuroscience. Various lines of research have addressed the basic phenomenal characteristics of mind wandering---
\begin{quote}
    \textit{a shift in the contents of thought away from an ongoing task and/or from events in the external environment to self-generated thoughts and feelings.}
    
    \cite{SmallwoodSchooler2006,SmallwoodSchooler2015}.
\end{quote}
We can all find moments when the train of thought shift away from the tasks at hand, and sometimes getting annoyed by the mind wandering episode. The intuition has lead to researches describing mind wandering as an `attention lapse' \cite{McVayJOEP2009, McVay2012}, implying the occurrence of mind wandering is an unintended failure. When the study explicitly instruct the participant to perform a task, the time not focusing on the task are considered as `mind wandering'. Such research design dismissed the possibility of voluntary engagement of the mind wandering state. 

Recent investigations have found that mind wandering can occur with or without intention \cite<see review from>{SeliTiCS2016}. 
The participant can, however, intentionally mind wander if they lack a motivation to engage in the experiment. When a simple yes/no question is asked about the mind wandering state, the response cannot access the nature of the occurrence. When participants are asked about the nature of mind wandering period in laboratory scenario, a proportion of the mind wandering period is intentional. The reason behind intentional mind wandering  could be the lack of motivation to complete the task
\cite{SeliJoEP2015}
, or the task is not mentally demanding to have all the attention resource allocated to the task \cite{SeliPsychScience2016}. 
The occurrence of intended and unintended mind wandering can also be down to individual differences. 
Intentional and unintentional mind wandering have been found to be deferentially associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder \cite<ADHD;>{SeliADHD2015} and obsessive-compulsive disorder \cite<OCD;>{SeliOCD2017}. More fine-grained investigation on the commonality of mind wandering will help resolve the conflict in the definition.

\subsection{Heterogeneity in functional outcomes}

Although mind wandering is a common occurrence in our day-today life, the functional consequence remains poorly understood \cite{SmallwoodFrontiers2013, Mooneyham2013}. Mind wandering has been considered the reason of poor executive control during working memory task \cite{McVayJOEP2009}. Individuals who mind-wandered more during fluid intelligent testing perform less well \cite{MrazekJoEP2012}. Mind wandering leads to bad reading comprehension due to failure in the construction of the mental models of ongoing events \cite{Smallwood2008}. Comprehension ability is related to working memory capacity and mediated by the ability to suppress mind wandering \cite{McVayReading2012, Unsworth2013}. Mind wandering has been linked to unhappiness \cite{Killingsworth2010} and a indicator of depression \cite{Smallwood2007}. The evidence above supported the highly disruptive nature of mind wandering and its potential costs to cognitive performance.

In addition to exploring the costs of mind wandering, researchers have discovered its potential benefits. Mind wandering may facilitate creative solution to an old problem \cite{Baird2012, Smeekens2016} and recovery from negative emotional states \cite{RubyPlos2013, PoerioFrontiers2016}. Mind wandering relays on mental time travel---the metal capacity of remembering the past and imagining the future \cite{Stawarczyk2015}.  Mind wandering can refine personal goals \cite{Medea2016} and is associated with the neural mechanism supporting mental time travel \cite{DArgembeau2006,DArgembeau2015}. 

The wide-range of associated functional outcomes suggests mind wandering is not a homogeneous state. To reconcile this contradictory evidence, researchers have suggested that mind wandering may be heterogeneous, encompassing multiple states with differential contents and underlying cognitive architectures \cite{SmallwoodFrontiers2013}. Different functional associations arise from different `types' of experience, which explains the range of functional outcomes observed in the literature.


\subsection{Heterogeneity in experiential profiles}
Self-report is commonly used to understand the content of mind wandering thoughts and on-going experience. The content of mind wandering has a wide variety of topics and modality. Studies using principle component analysis (PCA) have revealed more detailed experiential profiles. Temporal information is one common theme \cite{RubyFP2013,RubyPlos2013}. The content of mind wandering is mainly future-focused \cite{Baird2011}, therefore mind wandering often involves planning for the future goals of the individual. On the contrary, when the mind wanders in an unhappy mood, the content is drawn to events from its past \cite{Smallwood2011}. The form of spontaneous thoughts is likely to be imagery or verbal \cite{Gorgolewski2014,Smallwood2016}. Investigations in experiential profiles is the first step into explore the commonality of various type of mind wandering. However, the link between different experiences and the cognitive aspect is not yet well described.

\subsection{Theoretical accounts of Mind Wandering}
Although mind wandering is both a cause of error in external tasks and unhappiness, it is also a correlate of creativity and personal problem solving. In addition, it is a correlate of both greater and lesser executive control. The discovery on mind wandering can be formalised into two theoretical accounts. The executive failure account aim to understand the conditions that trigger or associate with mind wandering. Researches on the mechanism behind the occurrence of mind wanderings is the representational account. In other words, the executive failure account examines why mind wandering happens, while the representational account interests in how human mind wanders. The differences in research interest illustrates how two accounts develop conflicting views of mind wandering. 

\subsubsection{Executive failure account}
The executive failure account argues that mind wandering occurs during attention-demanding tasks when control processes are insufficient to deal with the interference created by off-task thoughts \cite{McVay2010}. Mind wandering results from a failure of executive control over internally generated thoughts, rather than as consuming executive resources. The researches focus on the negative effect of mind wandering on the development of negative mood and task performance. Mind wandering thoughts are mostly unhappy in ecologically valid scenario \cite{Killingsworth2010}. Depressive thinking correlates with the frequency of mind wandering \cite{Smallwood2007}. Mind wandering has been considered the reason of poor executive control during working memory task\cite{McVayJOEP2009}. Executive error and slow reaction time correlates with individual differences in working memory capacity and mind wandering \cite{McVay2012}. The capacity to avoid mind wandering during demanding tasks is a potentially important source of success on measures of fluid intelligence \cite{MrazekJoEP2012}.

\subsection{Content of experience}

The conflicts in the mind wandering literature arise for the heterogeneous, unconstrained nature of mind wandering. To date, the mind wandering researches consist of investigations on three important aspects: experience, neural profile, and cognition (Fig.\ref{fig:intro:fig1}). A detailed description for the spontaneous thought is needed to confirm the experience during mind wandering. Neural organisation serves as the intrinsic biological basis of cognition. Finally, established cognitive measures link the functional outcome to the experiential profiles. Studies targeting relationships of a singular aspect and mind wandering. To paint the full picture of mind wandering, a multivaritate method will help incorporate the three aspects. 

The current thesis adapts a multivariate approach as the first step towards a new view on mind wandering. Multidimensional experience sampling \cite<MDES; >{Medea2016, RubyPlos2013, Smallwood2016} is the main technique of experience profile assessment. Resting state functional connectivity is used to describe the trait-like neural feature of each individual. The tasks selected measure cognitive functions documented in the past mind wandering literature, including executive control, fluid intelligence, episodic memory, semantic memory, and information generation. Finally, canonical correlation analysis \cite<CCA; >{Hotelling1936} is the conjoined-decomposition method of choice to explore the multivariate patterns of mind wandering. Here I present the overview of the mind wandering measure and the benefit of CCA used in the thesis.  

\subsection{Content of experience}

To access the complex, heterogeneous content of spontaneous thoughts, the current thesis employs MDES \cite{Medea2016, RubyPlos2013, Smallwood2016}. For the purpose of capturing momentary evolution of thoughts during experiments, experience sampling \cite{Kahneman2004} is the commonly used technique. MDES expanded the thought probe from a on/off task question to a collection of dimensions related to a wide range of form and content of thoughts. The idea of MDES is based on various questionnaires to understand the content of mind wandering thoughts retrospectively, such as the Dundee Stress State Questionnaire \cite{Matthews1999}, Amsterdam Resting-State Questionnaire \cite{Diaz2013}, the resting state questionnaire \cite{Delamillieure2010}, and New York Cognition Questionnaire \cite{Gorgolewski2014}. The questionnaires above involves more than 20 items, providing a comprehensive coverage of thought content. Direct implementation of the retrospective questionnaires listed above is not practical for experience sampling. Experience sampling is conducted along an external task, such as reading \cite{Franklin2011}, go/no-go task \cite{Christoff2009}, and n-back task\cite{Kane2007}. The list of questions need to be short and concise to minimum interruption of the external task.

The current version of MDES is based on 10-question set used in \cite{Medea2016} and \citeA{Smallwood2016}. In the previous work, the questions are separated into content and form aspect of experience. Principle component analysis (PCA) was used to extract latent linear structure in the spontaneous thought report. Each participant has a set of identified principle components concluding the average momentary state of all the sampled time period. The current version includes both form and content questions in one set with three extra questions. The average score of each thought dimension indicate the average momentary state of spontaneous thought.

\subsection{Method of acquiring experience}

In the current thesis, both online and retrospective method are used to acquire content of mind wandering in laboratory scenario. In the second empirical study, New York Cognition Questionnaire \cite{Gorgolewski2014} is used to acquire the trait-like multidimensional mind wandering thought content during a 9-minute resting state fMRI session. The retrospective method measures the summary of the mind-wandering experience during a specified time period. The benefit of retrospective measure is that no interruption during the given task or the on-going thoughts will happen. The trait-level features of mind wandering are accessed in the retrospective report. 

In the online measure, MDES serves as the thought probes to record participant's experiences during a give task. A hybrid of go/no-go task and n-back task was used to manipulate working memory capacity to induce mind wandering \cite{Konishi2015, Medea2016}. The earlier version has used number as the test items \cite{SmallwoodNI2013}. The majority of the experiment consist of nontarget presented in neutral colour and a small proportion of targets. The participant are instructed to judge whether the target number is odd or even. In the \textit{choice reaction time} (i.e. 0-back) condition, the judgement is made when the number changes colour; in the \textit{working memory} (i.e. 1-back) condition, participants judge the number on the previous screen when presented with a question mark. The improved version is proposed by Konishi and colleagues \citeyear{Konishi2015}, replacing number with two 2-dimensional geometric shapes separated by a vertical line. Each pair consists of a two shapes among a circle, a triangle, and a square, each in two different left/right configurations. In the 0-back condition, the target is flanked by one of two shapes, and participants indicate which shape matches the target shape. In the 1-back condition, the target is flanked by two question marks, and participants match the target shape to the prior trial. Thought probe appears during the task in a semi random fashion. The online measure captures spontaneous thought in, possibly, both mind-wandering and task-focused moments. In the first and third empirical studies, the averaged momentary report from MDES is used to capture the trait-like feature of spontaneous cognition.

\subsection{Conjoined decomposition of brain and cognition}

Despite invented in the 30s, CCA has not aroused researchers’ interests due to the lack of practicality. With the advance on computing resource and enriched data size, CCA has gained popularity in neuroimaging research. Three characteristic of CCA make it the choice of method---joint information compression, symmetry, and multiplicity (details described in the Method chapter). CCA can be understood as a natural extension of PCA to two variable sets, but mutually linked by a joint correlation criterion. Such extension enables the exploration of neuro-experiential component pairs of mind wandering. CCA does not distinguish between the two variable sets during the information compression process. The identified dual-component dimensions correlates two aspect the data together without indication of causality between neural function and cognition. CCA is capable of estimating more than one corresponding component pair from the two variable sets. More than one pair of meaningful decomposition can be found, giving it the potential to examine the heterogeneity of mind wandering content and their functional outcome. 

While CCA provided useful features to explore the heterogeneity of mind wandering, its sparsity variation overcomes two technical issues of CCA application. Performing feature selection with sparsity improve the interpretability of the data and model fit. The data with more number of features than samples is accompanied with consequences of the so-called curse of dimensionality---the more dimensions are added to a data set, the less explanatory value a sample would have \cite{Domingos2012}. The number of functional connectivity measure can easily exceed the number of samples. In sum, SCCA allows decomposition on functional connectivity measures without sacrifice of data richness or interpretation difficulty of prior data compression. The pros and cons of CCA and its variation is disccussed in the next chapter.

The current thesis adopt the sparse variation of CCA \cite<SCCA; >{WittenSCCA2009} to resolve arguments related to heterogeneity in mind wandering. Most studies in mind wandering have only focused on its relationship with one cognitive outcome at a time. As a consequence, mind wandering is treated as a singular construct. Studies on contents of spontaneous thoughts have shown the diversity of information using self-report methods. Based on the heterogeneity of content of spontaneous thoughts, mind wandering can be a collection various type of spontaneous thoughts. Adopting multivariate method has the potential to identify family resemblance among the heterogeneity of mind wandering, and to begin the research on the ontological view of mind wandering.

\section{Summary}
In the current PhD, we would like to explore the numerous thoughts to describe human consciousness experience and establish a framework that incorporate the heterogeneity of the mind-wandering experience. The wide range of functional outcomes and contents of the mind-wandering state is perplexing as often time, those features are contradictory against each other. These studies indicated that the mind-wandering state is a heterogeneous collection of experiences that each type of the mind-wandering experiences has its own underlying cognitive mechanism and contextual representation (Smallwood \& Andrews-Hanna, 2013). The current difficulty of advancing the mind-wandering research is that, although the related cognitive and experience phenotypes has been found, we are unsure about the mechanism uniting those features. Moreover, the integrative nature of higher level cognition makes it difficult to identify the contribution of different processes to the mind-wandering state. This PhD aims to advance the understanding of the identified cognitive processes and find the quantifiable features of the cognitive measures that can infer the mind-wandering states. With the combination of MDES that accesses the heterogeneity of the content, cognitive phenotypes and the neuroimaging data, this PhD aims to establish the ontology of spontaneous thoughts and lays a solid foundation for future studies in consciousness.
